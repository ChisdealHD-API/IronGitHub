C# client for GitHub Api v3

Why
==========
- Needed GitHub Gist integration for [CodeSaber](https://github.com/in2bits/codesaber) (among other things)
- [csharp-github-api](https://github.com/sgrassie/csharp-github-api) didn't do what I needed yet and I wanted to try it for myself
- [GitHubSharp](https://github.com/erikzaadi/GitHubSharp) is [Not compatible with v3 API](https://github.com/erikzaadi/GithubSharp/issues/13)
